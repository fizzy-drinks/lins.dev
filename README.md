This is the source code for my personal website built using my favourite tooling.

It also uses [nasin nanpa](https://github.com/ETBCOR/nasin-nanpa) to render sitelen pona characters.

The new version is currently a work in progress meant to be the home for my portfolio of projects
and support multiple languages.

## Help translating

I'm not fluent in toki pona, but I'll try to maintain the toki pona version of site because I love
the concept behind it. If you find any mistakes, please point them out!
