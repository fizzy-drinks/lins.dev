# [lins.dev](https://lins.dev)

This is the source code for my personal website. It currently runs on NextJS and TypeScript and
uses Tailwind for styling.

It also uses [nasin nanpa](https://github.com/ETBCOR/nasin-nanpa) to render sitelen pona characters
and [react-twemoji](https://github.com/zxmys/react-twemoji) to render Twemoji from Twitter and some
other libraries in the old site (now relegated to `/old`).

The new version is currently a work in progress meant to be the home for my portfolio of projects
and support multiple languages. So far, the maintenance message and a couple project summaries have
been translated to English, Portuguese and toki pona (if you don't know what that is,
[check it out!](https://tokipona.org/)).

## Recruiters and clients

If you're here, there's a good chance you're hiring. If you need to contact me, email g@lins.dev
and I will get back to you shortly.

## Help translating

I'm not fluent in toki pona, but I'll try to maintain the toki pona version of site because I love
the concept behind it. If you find any mistakes, please point them out!
